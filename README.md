# Portfolio Website - Z-Index Fix

## Changes Made

I've fixed the issue with the navigation elements appearing above the banner and behind the logo by adjusting the z-index values in the CSS:

1. **Showreel Banner**: Kept at `z-index: 100` to ensure it stays below other elements
2. **Floating Navigation Bar**: Set to `z-index: 1200` to ensure it appears above the banner
3. **Logo Circle**: Set to `z-index: 1300` to ensure it appears above the navigation bar

This creates the correct stacking order where:
- The banner stays at the bottom layer
- The navigation elements appear above the banner
- The logo circle appears at the topmost layer, ensuring it's never hidden behind other elements

## Files Modified

- `styles.css` - Updated z-index values for proper layering

## Visual Hierarchy

After these changes, the visual hierarchy should be:
1. Logo Circle (topmost)
2. Navigation Bar
3. Showreel Banner (bottom layer)

This ensures that the navigation elements appear properly above the banner but behind the logo circle, creating a clean visual hierarchy that matches your industrial design aesthetic preferences.
